# Counter-App

I made a cool counter app! It's super simple. The app counts stuff for you—like, anything you want. Just tap the plus button, and the number goes up. Need to decrease? Hit the minus button. It's like a digital tally. Perfect for tracking snacks, study sessions, or anything else. The design is clean, with big buttons, so it's easy-peasy. No fancy stuff, just a handy counter in your pocket. It's my little project to make life easier. Counting made fun and straightforward—boom, done!
